Odin Project: To-Do List<br>
A simplistic approach to a to-do web app.

Working out how to use the module pattern more effectively.
First attempt at using localStorage for saving data.
It's pretty ugly, but I wanted to come out of this project with a better handle on organization, and becoming more efficient<br>
with OOP and functional programming.
